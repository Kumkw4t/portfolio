However today, I lean more towards online competitive games (TFT, Trackmania, Valorant) or beautiful small indie games. Special note to Ori and the Blind Forest and Hades."

Unfortunately there are too many hobbies I like and not enough time in a day (or a year for that matter). When I have time though, I love crafting some things as it is both soothing and relaxing."
